I am a PostDoc researcher at [COSIC, KU Leuven](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/), where I accomplished my PhD under the supervision of 
[Frederik Vercauteren](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pYTEVIEAAAAJ&hl=en), [Nigel Smart](https://nigelsmart.github.io/), and [Ilia Iliashenko](https://iliailia.github.io/). My research interests include 
both the theoretical aspects and practical applications of privacy-enhancing technologies (PET). 

This is the [pdf version](/files/resume.pdf) of my CV.
