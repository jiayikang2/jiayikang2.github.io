I am a PhD researcher at [COSIC, KU Leuven](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/) under the supervision of 
[Frederik Vercauteren](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pYTEVIEAAAAJ&hl=en), [Nigel Smart](https://nigelsmart.github.io/), and [Ilia Iliashenko](https://iliailia.github.io/). My research interests include 
both the theoretical aspects and practical applications of privacy-enhancing technologies (PET).

Previously, I obtained an MSc in Mathematics from KU Leuven (with great distinction) and a Master of Physics from the University of Manchester 
(first class honors). Prior to that, I received a BSc in Physics from Xi'an JiaoTong University (honor science program).  

This is the [pdf version](/files/resume.pdf) of my CV.
